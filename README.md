# Individual plant detection and tracking for agricultural robotics in precision field management

### Overview
1.	Developed a lightweight, accurate model for individual plant detection and tracking using StrongSORT.
2.	Constructed a labeled dataset covering ten crop and weed species under natural field conditions.
3.	Deployed and validated the model on Jetson Orin NX, demonstrating robust performance in both known and unseen environments.
